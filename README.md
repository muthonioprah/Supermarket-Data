# Supermarket-Data Analysis

As data scientists we have been tasked to perform analysis on a dataset containing a list of Kenyan retail Supermarkets.

The dataset has information on items, location, day, type of payments among other variables.

Historically, supermarkets have their business models radically reshaped by payments, locations and the products stocked.

This analysis seeks to increase sales volume thus benefiting the business as a whole by finding out the following information:

The most preferred payment method (cash, mpesa or visa card.

The most generated sales from individuals in the branch.

The time of the day or night do supermarkets receive the most traffic (weekdays/weekends)?

The most popular category of products

Did consumers prefer chain/medium or small stores?

Whether having high-end consumables benefit the supermarket more than low end consumables

A data report was written containing the analysis process and recommendations
